                    <p>User experience (abbreviated as UX) is how a person feels when they are interacting with a system, whether it’s a website, web application or desktop software. UX designers study and evaluate how users feel about and use a system, looking at things like ease of use, perception of the value, utility, and efficiency in performing tasks. They crunch data, organize information, understand human behaviour as it relates to their projects, and create interactive experiences that draw users in and keep them coming back.
