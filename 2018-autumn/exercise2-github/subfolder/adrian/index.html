                                The Burger Shack is a place where you can eat really delicious burgers located in the center of Aarhus. The burger here is relatively simple and traditional in its basic form. But it is made for something near perfection.

                            <p class="burgerp2"><br><span class="titlu6">Dishes</span><br><br>

                                Delicious, light bowl, fine filling, not overtaking, and not least a flame-steak steak, just doing it - just to prove that it's the one that binds the whole burger together! Everything around the steak compliments the taste well, but the "center of attention" is definetly the medium-rare-fried steak that simply spoils your taste buds.

                                Pomfritters, with the very special blend of parmesan and thyme, are simply heaven! However, there might be more - and even the same amount - dip in the beans, and Coca Cola would like to come back to bed again.
